# Cubic³ CEO Demo Script (Exec Summary)

## Goal
Show instant answers on global SDV connectivity coverage, roaming performance, OEM program insights, and investor-grade metrics using the Cubic³ Connected Vehicle Agent.

## Prompts to try
- “Summarize coverage and latency by country and OEM program; highlight attach success and roaming headroom.”
- “Break down revenue/ARPU by OEM, model, and region; show gross adds vs churn.”
- “What did the SoftBank investment and recent press releases say about growth drivers and platform scale?”
- “Where are infotainment/StreamLocal³ or DriverConnect³ issues surfacing, and which MNO partners are implicated?”
- “Which regions need additional partner capacity to support rising data consumption?”

## Narrative
1) **Coverage & Capacity**: Ask for footprint and attach success by country and MNO partner; highlight resiliency and roaming headroom for OEM programs.
2) **Performance**: Request latency/packet loss trends by service type (infotainment, telemetry/OTA, payments) and flag hotspots needing partner tuning.
3) **Commercial Mix**: Ask for revenue/ARPU by OEM, model, and region; surface top growth programs and churn risk.
4) **Investors & Funding**: Summarize the SoftBank stake (€473M for 51%) and growth levers (17M+ vehicles, 190+ countries, 550+ networks); capture cash, leverage, and capex signals where available.
5) **Sustainability & Compliance**: Ask for data privacy, security, and lawful intercept readiness for roaming/VoLTE/VoNR; call out compliance posture.
