# Cubic³ Strategy Playbook (Demo, 2025)

## Vision
Deliver the leading SDV connectivity and experience platform—global coverage with compliant roaming, analytics, and UX layers for OEMs and partners.

## 2025 Priorities (public signals + demo assumptions)
- Expand partner depth: optimise QoS with existing MNOs and onboard new partners to reduce latency and improve attach.
- Grow program depth: focus on OEM launches, infotainment/StreamLocal³ adoption, DriverConnect³ experience metrics, and FleetWallet³ readiness.
- Performance & resilience: maintain high attach success, reduce latency for infotainment/streaming, proactive congestion management by country/partner.
- Customer/driver experience: SLA-backed services, faster activation/OTA, tighter incident comms for OEMs and drivers.
- Security & compliance: VoLTE/VoNR lawful intercept readiness, privacy/security posture, and reliable payments handling.

## Market Position
- Differentiators: global roaming reach (190+ countries, 550+ networks), 17M+ vehicles and 450k+/month adds, SDV-first analytics and UX stack.
- Competitors: other connected-vehicle and telematics providers; differentiation via partner breadth, QoS observability, and integrated analytics/experience layers.

## Go-To-Market Motions
- OEM programs: prove attach/latency, OTA reliability, and driver experience gains; co-market successful launches.
- Infotainment/StreamLocal³: highlight localized content and QoS outcomes.
- Payments/FleetWallet³: emphasize secure, compliant in-vehicle payments.
- Analytics/Explore³: deliver insights on consumption, anomalies, and churn/experience risk.

## KPIs (examples for the agent)
- Attach success, latency, jitter, packet loss by country/partner/OEM program.
- Revenue/ARPU and margin by OEM/model/region; churn/renewals and OTA success rates.
- Activation/OTA lead times and incident MTTR; NPS/CSAT and churn risk signals.
- Compliance/security metrics: privacy posture, lawful intercept readiness, uptime for payments/infotainment.
