# Cubic³ Operations Demo Script (Connectivity & Service Delivery)

## Goal
Show how the agent answers roaming performance, capacity planning, and service delivery questions across Cubic³’s SDV connectivity footprint.

## Prompts to try
- “Show attach success, latency, and packet loss by country, MNO partner, and OEM program for the last 30 days; flag hotspots.”
- “Where do we need additional partner capacity or QoS tuning to support rising infotainment traffic?”
- “List top OEM models or routes with highest utilisation and any congestion alerts.”
- “Summarize SLA performance for infotainment/StreamLocal³ and payments/FleetWallet³, including any recent incidents.”
- “What security/compliance controls are in place for VoLTE/VoNR roaming and lawful intercept?”
- “How many active vehicles are connected, and which regions/programs are most utilised?”

## Narrative
1) **Availability & Latency**: Request trends by country and MNO; expect hotspot callouts and mitigation steps.
2) **Capacity & Planning**: Ask about partner/gateway load and where to expand throughput for OEM programs with rapid growth.
3) **Service Delivery**: Ask for activation/OTA cycle times, ticket volume, and blockers (SIM profile, regulatory, ground infra).
4) **Security & Compliance**: Ask for resilience posture for payments/infotainment data and recent drills or failovers.
5) **ESG & Responsibility**: Highlight privacy, compliance, and sustainable operations commitments.
