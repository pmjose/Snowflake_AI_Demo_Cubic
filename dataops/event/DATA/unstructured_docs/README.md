# Legacy Unstructured Documents (Demo)

This folder currently contains legacy satellite-branded reference material from the original demo. For the Cubic³ customization, treat these as **placeholder content** for Cortex Search until you replace them with Cubic³ product briefs, runbooks, SLAs, and press/investor materials.

Content is synthesized for demonstration only and was derived from legacy investor/ESG PDFs and public website facts. Do not treat as production data.

**Recommended next step for full Cubic³ alignment:** replace these PDFs/MD files with Cubic³ public materials (e.g., SoftBank investment press release, Cubic³ Explore³/DriverConnect³/StreamLocal³ product sheets, connectivity compliance/roaming runbooks). Update `dataops/event/telco_upload_files.template.sql` file paths if you add new documents.

## Folders

- strategy/: multi-orbit priorities, vertical plays
