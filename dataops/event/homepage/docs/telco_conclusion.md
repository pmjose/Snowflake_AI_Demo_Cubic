# <h1black>🎉 Congratulations! You've </h1black><h1blue>Completed the Lab</h1blue>

## <h1black>What You've </h1black><h1blue>Accomplished</h1blue>

In this hands-on lab, you've successfully built and deployed a complete **AI-powered connected vehicle operations and driver support platform** using Snowflake Cortex AI and Snowflake Intelligence. Here's what you've mastered:

### <h1sub>Data Processing & AI Functions</h1sub>

✅ Loaded structured connectivity, support, and commercial data from CSV files (50,000+ records)  
✅ Transcribed driver support audio using `AI_TRANSCRIBE` with speaker identification  
✅ Extracted text from Cubic³ product/runbook documents using `AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT`  
✅ Analyzed sentiment across driver interactions  
✅ Translated text to multiple languages for global teams  

### <h1sub>Advanced Analytics & ML</h1sub>

✅ Built semantic search services for call transcripts and support tickets  
✅ Created semantic models for natural language queries with Cortex Analyst  
✅ Developed an intelligent Cortex Agent combining multiple AI tools  
✅ Identified at-risk OEM programs and calculated revenue/ARPU impact  
✅ Analyzed connectivity performance and infrastructure capacity  

### <h1sub>Snowflake Intelligence</h1sub>

✅ Created and configured a Cortex Agent with multiple tools  
✅ Used Snowflake Intelligence for conversational data exploration  
✅ Asked natural language questions across structured and unstructured data  
✅ Explored automatic tool routing and multi-source insights  
✅ Performed semantic search and queries with context awareness

## <h1black>Real-World </h1black><h1blue>Impact</h1blue>

The platform you've built demonstrates how Cubic³ can:

- **Reduce manual call review time by 90%+** through automated driver support transcription and analysis
- **Protect OEM and driver experience** by correlating sentiment with connectivity KPIs
- **Prioritize partner/MNO actions** by surfacing attach/latency hotspots and OTA regressions
- **Improve SLA compliance** for streaming, infotainment, and payments with proactive alerts
